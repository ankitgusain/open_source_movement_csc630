# Non Sibi Week

During the week of **2/12-2/16**, your focus will not be on your own projects.  That is, you will spend the week working on another person's project as your main focus.  This is _not_ to say that you are working on it "as if it were your own", because _a)_ it's not, and _b)_ that would require a whole lot of permissions and frustrations.  Rather, you should pick (or be assigned to) a project and work to produce a large pull request, or multiple small ones.  This will constitute a significant part of your [Coherence/Organization, Collaboration, and Community](https://nzufelt.github.io/open_source_movement_csc630/assignments/Project.html) grades for your final project.

### The Rules
1. Between Sunday, 2/11 11:59PM and Saturday, 2/17 00:00AM, you _cannot_ commit to your own repository.  The only activity you are allowed to complete on your own repository is accepting pull requests, or communications on Github.
2. Your work on your assigned repository should be made in a good-faith effort to be at a similar level of quality to the work on your own repository
3. Any attempts to subvert Other's Project Week by, for example, submitting a massive commit at 2/17 00:01AM will be noticed and reflected in your grade.
4. You also need to submit your usual, second weekly pull request which is not to your main assigned (classmate's) library.

### Suggestions
* Use this weekend in effort to get your repository as ready as possible to have outside help.  Create `README`s, `CONTRIBUTING` guidelines, Github issues, documentation, or other tools to assist others in contributing to your repository.
* Have fun, and ask _lots_ of questions!  Remember, the goal of this project is not to produce the world's most amazing repository, it's to learn about the open source community by being a part of it.
* Recalling that you will need to reflect on this time at the end of the term, I recommend you take notes now on this.
